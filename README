ProjectManagement
=================

This plugin belongs to the export / upload category. It provides functionality 
to export the current contents of the dradis repository into a package that
can be downloaded and stored as a backup.

It also provides a 'hook' to the import from file functionality in order to 
restore the state of dradis from one of these packages.

This version will preserve category associations of notes, whilst preventing 
duplicate categories from being created.

This plugin will work with any database supported by Rails' ActiveResource data 
access layer.
